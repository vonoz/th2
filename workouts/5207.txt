[COURSE TEXT]
0	Workouts with over-under interval sets like the ones found in Dragon...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
0	are very easily applied to real world scenarios	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
0	But oftentimes, our over-under intervals are consistent or predictable	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
0	Efforts in group rides or races are many things...	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
0	but rarely are they consistent or predictable	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
0	So we'll mix things up today!	5	0	0	72	16777215	60
0	But that's later. For now, focus on getting in a good warmup	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
240	Try to keep your spin in the 85-95rpm range	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
285	Now pick things up to 100rpm or higher...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
285	but only if you can do it without bouncing in the saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
300	Back to 85-95rpm	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
345	100 rpm or higher if you can control it	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
360	Slow it down a little	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
405	Last time, you know the drill ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
420	Each of the 8 sets consist of 45-second steady-state valleys  at 95-97% FTP...	8	0	0	72	16777215	140
420	followed by 15-second surges between 110-120% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	150
420	Some sets have as little as 5 surges, while the longest ones have 9	8	0	0	72	16777215	160
420	To make sure you get 100% benefit from today's workout...	8	0	0	72	16777215	170
420	put the workout window in horizontal mode...	8	0	0	72	16777215	180
420	and focus on the zoomed in view only	8	0	0	72	16777215	190
420	Don't worry about what's coming up, just focus on the moment at hand	8	0	0	72	16777215	200
420	Try to keep your cadence between 85-95rpm during the rests...	8	0	0	72	16777215	210
420	and +100 RPM during the surges	5	0	0	72	16777215	220
420	10 seconds to go, get ready to do some work	8	0	0	72	16777215	230
660	Pick it up, 85-95rpm	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
705	Hit it! +100 RPM	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
825	A little higher now, quick spin	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
900	The intensity has eased off, but don't let your cadence drop too far	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1005	Last one!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1020	Well done! Recovery time	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1020	We've got a shorter set this time, but let's make the most of it	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
1020	With each change of pace, change your position on the bike	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
1020	By change of position, we mean hand position this time	8	0	0	72	16777215	140
1020	For example, every time the pace changes...	8	0	0	72	16777215	150
1020	change from the tops to your hoods...	8	0	0	72	16777215	160
1020	or from your hoods to your drops	5	0	0	72	16777215	170
1200	Time to go! 85rpm or higher	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1200	Alright, if they are not there already, go to your hoods	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1200	Or in other words, grab just above your shift/brake levers	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1200	Stay in this position until the pace changes	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1245	Go down to your drops (lower hooks of your bars)	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1260	Alright, now grab the tops (center part of your bars)	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1260	This is the most relaxed position to ride in	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1260	It's good for recovery and is also commonly used when climbing	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1305	Go to your hoods!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1320	Now go down to your drops	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1320	Riding in the drops is arguably the most aerodynamic choice	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1320	Although it may feel like you aren't as powerful...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1320	you are more aerodynamically efficient, so it can be a trade-off	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1365	To the tops! Imagine you're climbing	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1380	Now to your hoods	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1380	Riding on your hoods is often the most common position	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1380	You have more control than when on the tops...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1380	and the position is a little more comfortable than the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1425	Down to the drops!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1440	Back up to the tops	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1440	There is a common temptation in this position you should be aware of...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1440	Whenever possible, keep your thumbs wrapped around the bars	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1440	Many crashes can be avoided by having a better grip on the bars	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1485	To the hoods!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1500	Spin lightly & breathe deeply	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1500	Alright, now that we've tested out the different positions...	8	0	0	72	16777215	150
1500	we'll spend more time in each, and learn more about them individually	8	0	0	72	16777215	160
1500	First up, we'll spend this next set on the hoods	8	0	0	72	16777215	170
1680	Spin it up for this long set	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1740	Riding on the hoods can be deceiving	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1740	Although it feels comfortable and in control...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1740	you are actually more vulnerable than while in the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1740	If you hit a bump while on the hoods...	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1740	it is relatively easy for your hands to slip off	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
1800	A good way to increase your leverage on the bars...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1800	is to wrap your little/ring fingers in between the bars & levers	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1800	By wrapping more of your hand around the hoods...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1800	you won't be as susceptible to losing your grip	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1980	Another thing to watch out for in this position is wasting energy	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1980	With so much leverage on the bars, it's easy to grip too hard...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1980	or use that leverage to move your body with each pedalstroke	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1980	Keep a solid but relaxed grip, and don't use it to pull your body	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
2205	Last one! Quick, relaxed spin	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2220	Take a few minutes to recover	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2220	Now it's time to work on riding from the tops	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
2220	As previously mentioned, this is commonly used for climbing	8	0	0	72	16777215	100
2220	But it's good for relaxing as well	5	0	0	72	16777215	110
2220	If you are a mountain bike rider, this position is valuable as well	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
2220	In each of these 3 positions, you tax your muscles slightly differently...	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
2220	so varying your position during training like this is important	8	0	0	72	16777215	140
2220	Almost time to go, start out relaxed	8	0	0	72	16777215	170
2400	And if it helps, imagine you are climbing during this effort	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2580	A concern when in this position is your pedalstroke	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2580	With such an upright position, it is easy to mash the pedals	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2580	This is never a good idea, but it's especially likely in this position	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2580	Mashing will manifest in a bobbing & unstable torso	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
2760	While in this position, make sure you're comfortable on the saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2760	Don't roll your hips forward & avoid sliding to the nose	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2760	Make sure your sit bones carry your weight on the saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2880	Almost there, stay strong yet relaxed!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2925	Last kick, make it look effortless	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2940	Well done! Catch that breath	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2940	This next one is slightly shorter, so let's work in the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
2940	For some, this is the most infrequently used position	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
2940	But if trained correctly, it can save a lot of energy you'd use battling the wind	8	0	0	72	16777215	140
2940	10 seconds to go, start to drop into position	8	0	0	72	16777215	170
3120	Make this first acceleration from the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	35
3165	Stay low, but not so low you can hit Target Power	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3240	An improper bike fit can be made evident while riding in the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3240	But many confuse a lack of flexibility for a poor fit	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3240	Both are related, but remember...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3240	it takes practice to be smooth & efficient while in the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3360	Don't be afraid to experiment with hand position too	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3360	Slight changes in hand position can relieve discomfort...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3360	and positively affect power output & stability	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3480	Don't let your cadence slow while in the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3480	It can be hard to maintain a fast cadence, so focus!	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3540	Nicely done!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3540	With those 3 positions out of the way, we only have 3 sets left!	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3540	During these final 3 sets, work on any position you wish...	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
3540	but work on being more efficient, less wasteful	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
3540	Drop your head & torso lower toward your bike...	8	0	0	72	16777215	140
3540	relax and calm your torso as you pedal...	8	0	0	72	16777215	150
3540	and smooth your pedalstroke as much as you can	8	0	0	72	16777215	160
3720	Round 6, pick it up!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3840	Remember, efficient is fast and anything you can do...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3840	to save a little energy here & there...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3840	can really add up over the course of a workout, outdoor ride or race	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3960	Smooth is fast, try to ditch any unnecessary tension	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4065	Last push! Make it look eeeeeasy	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4080	Spin those legs out and catch your breath	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4080	This is a tough set coming up so we'll take a different approach	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
4080	While working on the position of your choice...	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
4080	imagine you are in a rotating paceline with a few other riders	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
4080	We'll focus on how to make a paceline faster during the set	8	0	0	72	16777215	150
4080	While doing so, remember to stay in your position of choice	8	0	0	72	16777215	160
4080	Oh, this time let's shoot for a steady 85-95rpm throughout	8	0	0	72	16777215	170
4260	Pick it up!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4260	It's you and 3 other riders in the paceline	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
4260	This is a good number of riders if all of you are working together	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
4260	Looks like we're getting close to your turn at the front	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
4305	Your turn! Make sure you're in the drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4320	Good, now fall back in line	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
