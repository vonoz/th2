[COURSE TEXT]
0	Cirque is all about high but repeatable efforts	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
0	At first glance, Cirque looks like a purely Anaerobic-based workout...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
0	and you'll certainly be spending a lot of time in the Anaerobic zone...	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
0	but don't think your aerobic system won't be taxed as well	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
0	The short recoveries don't allow your respiration to drop very much...	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
0	so each subsequent interval will require less time for you to reach...	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
0	high percentages of your aerobic capacity (VO2max)	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
0	You have 7 sets of microbursts of varying lengths & wattage levels ahead of you	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
0	3-minute clearing effort in about 30 seconds, keep your legs quick	8	0	0	72	16777215	210
240	3 minutes at 90% FTP...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
240	with your cadence between 85-95rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
420	3 prepatory bursts coming up!	8	0	0	72	16777215	75
420	Use this opportunity to find your burst cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	85
420	Shoot for a high cadence of 100+ rpm if you can control it	8	0	0	72	16777215	95
420	Bring your cadence up before the interval begins	8	0	0	72	16777215	105
420	3...	1	0	0	72	16777215	117
420	2...	1	0	0	72	16777215	118
420	1...	1	0	0	72	16777215	119
546	Slow it down for most of a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
546	Get ready...	5	0	0	72	16777215	44
546	3...	1	0	0	72	16777215	51
546	2...	1	0	0	72	16777215	52
546	1...	1	0	0	72	16777215	53
606	Excellent, ease off the gas, slow your legs	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
606	Last time, get ready	5	0	0	72	16777215	44
606	3...	1	0	0	72	16777215	51
606	2...	1	0	0	72	16777215	52
606	1...	1	0	0	72	16777215	53
666	Clearly, leg speed will be a focal point of this workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	54
666	This means we'll want to focus on a couple of things:	8	0	0	72	16777215	64
666	Keeping your cadence high - shoot for at least 100rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	74
666	Also, stay seated and make one of the goals of this workout...	8	0	0	72	16777215	84
666	improved seated power & control	8	0	0	72	16777215	94
666	It's important to be able to generate big watts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	104
666	both out of the saddle AND in the saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	114
666	Today is very much about generating big power without standing up	8	0	0	72	16777215	124
666	The first set of 15-second intervals at 150% FTP starts in about a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	174
666	Each burst of 15 seconds at 150% FTP is followed by 15 seconds of rest...	8	0	0	72	16777215	184
666	and this sequence will repeat for about 5 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	194
666	Start bringing that cadence up	8	0	0	72	16777215	214
900	Quick legs, lots of power!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
915	Ease up but keep your legs spinning quickly	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
930	Get your legs speed all at once!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
945	Ease off the power, keep the leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
960	Again, go fast!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
975	OK, on your own for the next few repeats - stay quick & aware	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1065	Halfway through this set! Keep that cadence high	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1155	Only 3 microbursts left, stay tough!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1230	Last one!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
1245	One set down! Nicely done	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1245	Take some deep breaths, exhaling completely	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1245	Microbursts are hugely effective in terms of training response...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1245	because they allow you to accumulate a lot more...	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1245	work way above Threshold than you could manage in longer intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
1245	So, do your best to make the most out of each of these sets	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
1245	Stay in the saddle & maintain a fast cadence...	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
1245	and always with good form - we don't want to encourage bad habits	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
1245	Be sure you're not bouncing in your saddle despite a high cadence...	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
1245	and be sure your knees are not wobbling about	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
1245	Also, avoid carrying tension in your upper body, especially your shoulders	8	0	0	72	16777215	100
1245	This might seem like a lot to focus on...	8	0	0	72	16777215	110
1245	but everything will eventually come together, quite naturally...	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
1245	if you focus on one piece of the "form puzzle" at a time	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
1245	Second set of 30-second microbursts at 130% FTP coming up in a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	255
1245	Again, you'll have 15 seconds worth of rest between intervals...	8	0	0	72	16777215	265
1245	so keep that cadence high for the whole set because it can get ...	8	0	0	72	16777215	275
1245	even MORE taxing trying to raise your cadence over & over again	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
1560	Find a good breathing rhythm straight away...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1560	even if you don't need deep breaths just yet	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1560	Exhale fully & the rest will take care of itself	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1590	Ease up but don't lose any leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1605	Just like last time, try to get all your speed/power at once	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1605	And if you're using an electronic trainer like a KICKR or CompuTrainer...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1605	it's really important that you set your cadence BEFORE the resistance spikes	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1635	So for those on electronic trainers in Erg mode, keep your spin stable	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1650	For those riders on more traditional trainers...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1650	you too will be best off with a quick spin the whole time, but...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1650	You'll need to add a couple gears just as the interval starts & hammer!	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1680	Ease off the power but keep the legs quick	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1695	Hammer to the halfway point!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1725	Halfway though! Don't bail out of an interval unless you HAVE to...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1725	no bailing just because you WANT to ;-)	3	0	0	72	16777215	10
1740	30 seconds of focus & speed	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1740	10 more seconds, don't back off even a little!	5	0	0	72	16777215	20
1770	Is your cadence still high? Keep it there	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1830	Last couple bursts but ALL your focus is on this interval only	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1860	Nice, keep your legs zinging along	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1875	Last one! Keep that pretty pedaling intact	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1905	Well done! Keep those pedals turning forward for a minute if you can	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1905	Avoiding immediate backpedaling will ultimately help you recover faster	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1905	Time to enjoy 5, well-earned minutes of recovery	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1905	30 seconds until round 3 begins	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
1905	Find your high cadence, preferably above 100rpm...	8	0	0	72	16777215	295
1905	and maintain it for all 6 of these 45-second segments at 120% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	305
2220	Shoot for 90+rpm for this entire set, 100+ if possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2220	Maintaining a higher cadence will shift the onus from your muscles...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2220	to your heart & lungs making your spin more aerobic	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2220	This is a more efficient way to ride in terms of sparing your muscles & sugar stores	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
2220	5 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	40
2265	Excellent, same 15-second recoveries though...seems unfair ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2280	Hit it again, get your power & spin as fast as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2280	30 more seconds, don't let your leg speed slip away	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
2280	20 seconds, don't ease up, don't tense up	8	0	0	72	16777215	25
2280	Final 10 seconds, tons of control	5	0	0	72	16777215	35
2325	Keep your legs turning quickly, no time to backpedal	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2340	45 seconds, powerful & steady	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2340	30 seconds to go, make sure your sit bones are anchored	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
2340	10 seconds, hold it steady	5	0	0	72	16777215	35
2385	Halfway through the set, spin lightly but quickly	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2400	If possible, slip down into a more aero position...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2400	preferably, with your hands in the drops if you can hold your power	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2400	20 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	25
2400	10 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	35
2445	Excellent! Ease up but keep spinning	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2460	Keep all your focus on this interval only	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2460	It's seldom beneficial to allow your mind to get too far ahead...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2460	so keep it right here, right now	5	0	0	72	16777215	20
2460	15 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	30
2460	10 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	35
2460	5 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	40
2505	Very nice! Only 1 to go, keep spinning	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2520	Last effort in the set, make it the best looking one yet	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2520	The more fluid & relaxed you ride, the less wasteful you become	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2520	So even though you're becoming more & more fatigued...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2520	There's no reason to show it by riding poorly - fluid & relaxed	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
2520	5 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	40
2565	That's 3 sets down! Keep 'em turning forward for a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2565	Remember to fully exhale to get your breathing & HR under control	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2565	4th set of 11 microbursts in about a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	255
2565	These are 18-seconds in length & will put you at 140% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	265
2565	You know the drill by now, keep that cadence high & steady...	8	0	0	72	16777215	275
2565	even during the short recovery valleys which aren't quite long enough...	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
2565	to allow you to backpedal more than 5 seconds at the most	8	0	0	72	16777215	295

3111	Try to keep your jump "explosive"	8	0	0	72	16777215	0

3210	1...	1	0	0	72	16777215	17
3228	4 brutal sets behind you!	5	0	0	72	16777215	2
3228	The last three sets are a repeat of the first three sets of this workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	192
3228	If you've made it this far without skipping any intervals...	8	0	0	72	16777215	202
3228	bravo, that's pretty impressive...but chances are, you've bailed once or twice	8	0	0	72	16777215	212
3228	So now it's up to you to decide how best to finish these latter sets	8	0	0	72	16777215	222
3228	Option 1: Skip 1-2 intervals over the course of each set by backpedaling	8	0	0	72	16777215	232
3228	This inserts some longer recoveries & helps maintain high quality in the other intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	242
3228	Option 2: Drop the Workout Intensity 5-10%	8	0	0	72	16777215	252
3228	This increases your chances of completing ALL the intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	262
3228	Each approach has its merits, so ask yourself a simple question...	8	0	0	72	16777215	272
3228	Which option sounds tougher to me?	8	0	0	72	16777215	282
3228	Choose the option you prefer LESS, it's likely the one you need MORE	8	0	0	72	16777215	292
3228	Here we go, bring that leg speed up!	8	0	0	72	16777215	302
3540	We'll let you handle this set on your own, you know what to do by now	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3615	3 down, focus on the next 3	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3705	Excellent, you're halfway through this final set of 15-second microbursts	8	0	0	72	16777215	0

3855	Final burst, prettiest one of this entire set!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3885	Nice! Keep the legs moving forward for a minute or so...	8	0	0	72	16777215	5
3885	before backpedaling or stretching out your severely worked muscles	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
3885	Another round of 30-second intervals at 130% FTP in about 30 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	285

4200	Shoot for 100+rpm & we'll check back in every few intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4320	Legs still quick? Only ease off the speed if you plan to skip a burst	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4410	Hang in there for all 3 of these closing bursts	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4455	Only 2 to go, focus intently on keeping your form throughout each of them	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4500	Only one to go, hide the fatigue & pedal beautifully	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4545	Well done yet again, spin out the heaviness	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4545	Final set ahead and it's only at 120% FTP...	8	0	0	72	16777215	255
4545	for 45 seconds at a time with tiny 15-second rests, sure...	8	0	0	72	16777215	265
4545	but nothing you can't handle with a lot of focus, guts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	275
4545	and maybe some workout modifications if you're in a tough spot	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
4545	Either skip intervals or drop the Workout Intensity a bit...	8	0	0	72	16777215	295

4905	really fast legs become slightly less fast legs	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
