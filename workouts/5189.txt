[COURSE TEXT]
30	Time to get a measure of your sustainable power	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
40	For now, just settle into a quick but comfortable spin & keep your effort low	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
90	As you feel warmer, work a little harder but this is still the warm-up...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
100	So keep things easy and practice breathing with your belly	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
180	Keep your legs quick but don't ramp up your heart rate with leg speed...yet	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
240	In 1 minute, you'll do your first leg speed warm-up	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
250	This 1-minute stretch is about quick legs, NOT big watts	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
260	So you'll use an easy gear and spin quicker than you like	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
270	As long as there's no bouncing	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
290	Get ready to pick up your spin	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
300	Shift into a lighter gear, keep the watts low and spin quickly	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
330	Keep it quick, 30 seconds to go	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
350	10 seconds to go...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
360	Good, now ease up and spin easy for a minute	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
390	In 30 seconds, you'll do the same thing but for twice as long	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
400	If you need to slow your spin a little, that's ok...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
410	But you should still be spinning well above your natural cadence	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
420	Shift into an easy gear and pick it up	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
430	Settle into a quick spin that you think you can maintain	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
450	Relax...drop your shoulders, soften your elbows, loosen your grip	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
480	Minute to go. Spin a little quicker as long as you can sustain the speed	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
530	Keep your speed...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
540	Good, now slow things down and spin easy for a couple minutes	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
550	Just lift your knees and let your feet fall	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
600	Get ready to blow out the cobwebs	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
610	Over the span of the upcoming 4 minutes, you'll get an idea of your starting pace	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
620	This effort will serve 2 purposes: warmup & insight	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
630	The effort is below your sustainable power, just like the early minutes of your 20min efforts	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
640	So find a hard, sustainable pace but one that leaves some room to grow	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
650	Get ready...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
660	Pick up the effort and settle into a rhythm	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
720	This 4-minute effort is a short exercise in pacing...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
730	So if this pace isn't realistic for 4 minutes, then it's certainly not going to work for 20 minutes...twice	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
740	So be realistic and pay attention to how you feel	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
780	If you feel like you can work a little harder without overdoing it, pick it up a little	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
790	This is still below your maximum sustainable power though	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
840	Again, if you feel you can sustain more effort, work a little harder	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
870	30 seconds to go,..push harder!	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
890	Hold it...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
900	Excellent, now keep it really, really easy for these next 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1020	OK, settle into all-day pace and keep things light	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1030	The upcoming efforts will help you determine your endurance capability	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1040	By riding hard, but not so hard that you have to back off, you'll learn just how much work you can sustain	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1050	This estimate of your hour-power, maximal steady state power, threshold power...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1060	Or as we refer to it, your functional threshold power (FTP), will help tailor your workouts to your own capabilities	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1070	It will also serve as a good measure of improvement over the course of your season	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1080	By riding hard - but not too hard - for 20 minutes, resting only for 2 minutes, then riding for another 20 minutes...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1090	We will have a good idea of the sort of power you could sustain for about an hour	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1100	That brief 2-minute break won't allow you to fully recover, but it will reduce your average power a bit...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1110	And this will account for the drop in power that happens when two 20min efforts become one 60min effort	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1120	Thereby approximating - closely - your Functional Threshold Power, or FTP	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1140	We'll get started in 1 minute, but before that let's address the most common mistake riders make when assessing	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1150	Going out too hard	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1160	There's nothing to be gained by hurting yourself early on into a long effort	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1170	So err on the side of caution, especially during this first effort	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1180	Don't take that to mean this will be easy...it won't	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1190	OK, get ready!	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1200	Start working, but nowhere near the point that your legs flood	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1210	Take the first 2 minutes just to ramp up to a point that feels difficult but sustainable	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1230	30 seconds in, still plenty of room to grow your power	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1260	Another minute before you really settle in, still holding back	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1290	Feeling pretty good? Good - pay attention to your breathing and keep your legs clear of heaviness	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1320	Start to settle in but keep in mind there's plenty of work ahead	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1380	Legs are still clear, right? Good - keep them clear by breathing really well	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1390	Use your belly to breathe, not your chest	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1440	One more minute and we'll take inventory	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1500	Good! 5 minutes in with plenty of gas in the tank	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1510	Now's the time to start to micromanage your effort	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1520	You've probably found a pace pretty close to your max, sustainable pace...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1530	But it might need some tweaking	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1540	So ask yourself if you can hang on if you work just a LITTLE harder	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1550	Then work just a LITTLE harder, no big changes	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1560	Also consider if the pace is just a little too high considering how much time is left in this interval	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1570	And back off just a LITTLE, no big changes	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1770	Coming up on your next set of adjustments...assuming you need them	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1800	Halfway there, try to relax and breathe well	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1810	Same questions: Is this as hard as I can work? Is this just a little too hard?	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
1820	Small changes if you make changes at all	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2100	Only 5 minutes left till break-time, microadjust if you need to	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2160	4 minutes of focus, 4 minutes of patience...keep it steady	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2220	3 minutes to go but don't push any harder than you have been	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2230	By now you've found a tough but sustainable pace, so just hold that pace	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2280	2 minutes, stay relaxed and don't show your effort	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2290	No sense in wasting energy on poor form or pained expressions	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2340	Final minute, don't back off and don't ramp things up - STEADY	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2400	Excellent! One down	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2410	Keep things very easy over the next 2 minutes and try to calm your breathing and heart rate	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2490	OK, get ready to do it again	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2500	Same approach: Don't go out too hard, 2 minutes to ramp up	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2510	3 big, deep breaths	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2530	Steadily bring your effort back up, and don't worry about the numbers	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2540	Pay attention to how you FEEL and gently nudge up your effort for these first couple minutes	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2580	Another minute before you settle in, keep your legs burn-free	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2640	OK, should be settling in or very close...relax and clear your mind	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2650	Don't think of the work still ahead, rather focus on riding well	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2660	Smooth and relaxed with positive thoughts or a clear mind	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2810	Get ready to make some adjustments if necessary	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2820	Same questions: Too easy? Too hard? SMALL changes	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2830	There's always a temptation to target a goal wattage or pace...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2840	Don't do it, not today	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2850	Today is about understanding your current capabilities	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2860	Leave the boundary-broadening agony until later	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
2870	Make today about honesty and ditching your ego in pursuit of good data	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3120	It's that time again, micro-adjust if you feel the need	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3130	With just under 10 minutes left, your primary focus from here till the end is to remain steady	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3140	Everyone WANTS to back off but focused riders won't allow themselves the option	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3150	Hold your effort steady and be patient	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3420	Only 5 to go!	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3430	If you fell off pace a bit, lift your effort back up	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3440	Be encouraged by the fact that you're almost done!	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3480	4 minutes - STEADY	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3540	3 minutes - how's your breathing? Use your belly	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3600	Just 2 minutes to go, hang in there!	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3660	Final minute - no need to ramp things up, just stay steady	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3690	30 seconds! No sprinting, just hold that power	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3720	Nicely done! Now spin easy, breathe deeply, and clear off the junk	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3730	If you lost your form over the closing minutes...	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3740	Reclaim it here and show tired muscles how to behave appropriately	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3750	Fatigue is never an excuse for poor form, so warm down with excellent technique	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
3760	See you next time!	8	0	0	72	0xFFFFFF
