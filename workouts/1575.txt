480	but no bouncing	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
600	So the first thing to keep in mind is the number of sets	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
600	You have 5 sets of high intensity over-under intervals ahead...	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
600	and you have a finite amount of energy	8	0	0	72	16777215	140

600	Maintain a slightly higher cadence than normal...	8	0	0	72	16777215	160

1005	Pick it up & stay relaxed	5	0	0	72	16777215	0

1500	Spin easy & catch your breath	5	0	0	72	16777215	20
1500	OK, now let's talk about your cadence a bit	8	0	0	72	16777215	210
1500	Focusing on your technique is a great way...	8	0	0	72	16777215	220
1500	to make it through hard efforts like this - productive distraction	8	0	0	72	16777215	230
1500	Do your best to stay above 90rpm at all times except for the surges	8	0	0	72	16777215	240
1500	During the surges, jump up to above 100rpm, seated for now	8	0	0	72	16777215	250
1500	If you slow your cadence down, you're only hurting yourself	8	0	0	72	16777215	260

1920	Smooth & fast	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1920	Steady pressure all the way around	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
1965	Spin!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1980	When the power decreases, keep your cadence high	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1980	This will make it easier to transition to a different pace	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2025	Push!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2100	A little higher now, stay relaxed	5	0	0	72	16777215	0

2400	Catch your breath while you keep your legs spinning lightly	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2400	This upcoming third set will carry us over the halfway point	8	0	0	72	16777215	180
2400	Sounds like a good point to work on breathing	8	0	0	72	16777215	190
2400	In fact, let's get started on that now	5	0	0	72	16777215	200
2400	Often enough, we remember to breathe properly...	8	0	0	72	16777215	210
2400	only once we are out of breath	5	0	0	72	16777215	220
2400	But this is usually far too late	5	0	0	72	16777215	230
2400	Proper breathing is a habit to be developed & applied often	8	0	0	72	16777215	240
2400	So start by breathing in your nose & mouth...	8	0	0	72	16777215	250
2400	and push all that old air out with full belly exhaling	8	0	0	72	16777215	260
2670	Build it up & keep breathing fully	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2700	Find a comfortable and efficient rhythm, and remember...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2700	while the rhythm may change, keep your breaths full & belly-driven	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2745	Just because the pace increased...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2760	doesn't mean your breathing has to	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2760	Control your breathing, don't let it control you	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2880	Inhale through the nose & mouth	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3000	Exhale with force, from your diaphragm/abdomen	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3120	If you look down at your stomach when you're breathing...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3120	it should be visibly moving in & out, pooching then drawing in	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3120	Don't just breathe with your chest	5	0	0	72	16777215	30
3180	Higher pace, still the same control over your breathing	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3225	Focus your energy on exhaling	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3225	Your body will take care of inhaling	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
3240	A natural vacuum takes care of inhaling if you exhale with force	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3285	Last kick, make it smooth	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3300	Way to go! Spin out those heavy muscles	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3300	Only 2 sets left now, but limit your focus the the next one only	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3300	Take it really easy for a few more minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3300	Now let's work on mentally handling this type of discomfort	8	0	0	72	16777215	210
3300	Imagine a scenario where your power file would look like the screen	8	0	0	72	16777215	220
3300	It's very similar to riding with 3 other riders & trading equal pulls	8	0	0	72	16777215	230
3300	If you're a racer, it's very much like working in a 4-man breakaway	8	0	0	72	16777215	240
3300	If you aren't a racer, it's just another fast group ride with a few workers	8	0	0	72	16777215	250
3570	Build into this one, power & cadence	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3600	If you're out there riding hard with 3 other riders...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3600	the pulls will come fast & hard	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
3600	Remember that the goal isn't to break away...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3600	but instead to work together & share the workload	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3645	Your turn at the front, but don't go too hard!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3660	Drop back to the back of the line	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3660	One thing you'll realize right away is that you don't get to rest...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3660	when dropping to the back of the line	5	0	0	72	16777215	20
3660	At that point you're body is recovering from the long pull	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3705	Back to the front, SAME cadence	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3720	The rest comes once you have spent some time in line again	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3720	In this case, maybe 30 seconds into each 45-second stretch	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3720	And if you're committed to this visualization, here's another tip...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3720	Keep your spin between 85-95rpm the ENTIRE interval	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3765	Your turn! More power, same spin	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3780	When you take pulls, focus on fluidity & not disrupting the pace	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3780	If you wind it up too much you're likely to cause gaps in the line	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3780	But if you hold your cadence, and therefore your speed, steady...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3780	you won't be the rider who repeatedly "harms" the break	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3825	You're in the wind so you have to work harder...	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3825	but not faster, no change in speed	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
3840	When you're back in the draft, you get to ease up a little...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3840	but the speed stays the same, make sense?	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3840	Work harder for 15 seconds, ease up a little for 45 seconds...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3840	and keep the group's speed consistent the whole time	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3885	Same cadence, more power	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3900	Looks like the other riders are excited to get to the end!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3900	The overall pace just lifted and you're along for the ride	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3945	Bigger pull this time! Same cadence	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3960	Good! Now when you drop back...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3960	imagine staying as close to the others as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3960	Although minimal, the effects of drafting are felt laterally as well	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3960	So be close enough that you are almost touching elbows	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
4005	Time to pull! Keep it smooth & steady	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4020	Search for every bit of draft as you fall back into line	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4065	Strong & efficient pull! Don't disrupt the harmony ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4080	Almost to the end, let's pick up the pace for the final couple minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4080	Just a couple pulls left	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
4080	Strong pulls, but maintain unity with the other riders	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
4125	Pull! Keep it steady	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4140	Now that you're even more tired, work harder on efficiency	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4140	Be more aero, more fluid, more calm	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
4140	Breathe deeper & spin quicker	5	0	0	72	16777215	20
4185	Last pull! Same spin	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4200	Awesome! Way to keep things productive while suffering	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4200	Only one left now, but not until you recover for a few minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
4200	Use this final set to work on any of the points we've focused on	8	0	0	72	16777215	240
4200	We'll be here for encouragement and support :)	5	0	0	72	16777215	250
4470	Build into this one slowly, the fatigue is undoubtedly high	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
