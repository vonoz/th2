[COURSE TEXT]
0	Microburst workout profiles can be a bit scary...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
0	but this format is actually a little "friendlier" than you might think	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
0	Just the same, Gardiner is a tough workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
0	for improvement on a number of levels, but more on that later	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
0	For now, spin quickly & lightly and get warm	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
240	2-minute ramp with quick, +85rpm legs	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
360	Drop your power but keep your leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
360	During these practice bursts, home in on a realistic cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
360	Probably something in the 100-120rpm range	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
432	Keep your legs just as quick during these short breaks	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
504	Keep spinning but slow things down & rest up	8	0	0	72	16777215	6
504	Alright, let's talk microbursts	5	0	0	72	16777215	96
504	You're initial reaction may be to go as hard as you can...	8	0	0	72	16777215	106
504	but notice that each of these sets is at a different intensity	8	0	0	72	16777215	116
504	These aren't all out hammerfest efforts	5	0	0	72	16777215	126
504	Instead, they offer the option to find out what's repeatable & what's not	8	0	0	72	16777215	136
504	Your goal for the first few intervals of each set...	8	0	0	72	16777215	146
504	should be to hit your marks with high precision	8	0	0	72	16777215	156
504	After you get the precision down, we'll work on other things	8	0	0	72	16777215	166
504	The key to surviving full sets of microbursts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	176
504	is quality breathing & lots of leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	186
504	And both extend to the breaks as much as the work intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	196
504	Alright, 10 seconds and we're in it	8	0	0	72	16777215	206
720	Lots of leg speed, relaxed upper body	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
735	Back off and spin easy but stay quick	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
750	Fast legs!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
765	Still quick, breathe deeply	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
780	Again!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
795	By now you're getting the hang of it, yeah?	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
825	As you figure out your gearing, you might need to shift more than once	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
840	Hit it!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
855	Shifting multiple times might be necessary in order to hit your marks	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
885	Either that or a lot of leg speed, probably a combination of both	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
945	Remember, you don't benefit by working through your rest	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1050	Hit your mark every time or skip a burst for extra rest	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1185	Nice! Keep spinning, backward for a minute or two if need be	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1185	During the rests in between sets like this, feel free to backpedal	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1185	Try to keep your legs moving but recovery is the real concern	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1185	Use the first 4 intervals of this next set to get your bearings	8	0	0	72	16777215	135
1185	But while going through the set, focus on breathing	8	0	0	72	16777215	145
1185	With so little rest, it is easy to find yourself out of breath	8	0	0	72	16777215	155
1185	So establish a solid rhythm before the set begins	8	0	0	72	16777215	165
1185	Make sure you take deep breaths, but don't hold your breath	8	0	0	72	16777215	175
1185	When exhaling, push the old air out with force	8	0	0	72	16777215	185
1185	Most importantly, don't force yourself to hold the same rhythm	8	0	0	72	16777215	195
1185	The relentless repetition will require you to breathe faster...	8	0	0	72	16777215	205
1185	but eventually you'll top out & find a sustainable rhythm	8	0	0	72	16777215	215
1185	10 seconds left, get ready for a harder set this time	8	0	0	72	16777215	305
1500	Go! See how 160% repeats treat you	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1605	With 4 repeats in your legs, honestly assess your odds	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1635	Is this an effort level you can continue to repeat?	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1635	If not, drop the Workout Intensity	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
1665	But if you can repeat these frequently with only an occasional missed burst...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1665	leave things just as they are	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
1695	The objective is to repeat as many bursts as possible with high quality	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1725	Skipping one here & there is fine, but more than 2 per set isn't	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1755	You can backpedal through 2 bursts each set but during the third one...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1755	drop the intensity 10%	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
1785	This will keep you active for more bursts which is your primary goal	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1890	Big exhales, really clear the expired air	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1965	Nicely done! Take some time to recover, you earned it	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1965	Alright, we're going to pick it up even higher this time	8	0	0	72	16777215	75
1965	Each interval will be at 170% FTP	5	0	0	72	16777215	85
1965	But once again, this assumes you can repeat these efforts	8	0	0	72	16777215	95
1965	When you find yourself backpedaling through multiple bursts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	105
1965	it's time to reevaluate & probably drop the Workout Intensity	8	0	0	72	16777215	115
1965	Out of 16 repeats per set, you ought to be able to string together...	8	0	0	72	16777215	125
1965	4 or 5 bursts at a time	8	0	0	72	16777215	135
1965	If you can't do that, you're way better off dropping watts & repeating more bursts	8	0	0	72	16777215	145
1965	Now that we've got our breathing down from the last set...	8	0	0	72	16777215	225
1965	Let's talk about working on cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	235
1965	During each interval, strive to keep your cadence at 110rpm or higher	8	0	0	72	16777215	245
1965	During the rests, keep your spin nearly as quick but comfortable	8	0	0	72	16777215	255
1965	By keeping your cadence high throughout the set...	8	0	0	72	16777215	275
1965	you're more likely to avoid flooding your muscles and prolonging your power output	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
1965	And you won't get bogged down by a surprise burst...	8	0	0	72	16777215	295
1965	as the breaks magically get shorter & shorter ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	305
2280	Spin! High, steady cadence	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2310	Hit that Target Power!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2415	If necessary, you can backpedal for a few seconds during each recovery	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2415	But it has to be quick, 5 seconds tops	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
2430	How's your cadence? Upwards of 100rpm at least?	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2550	If your cadence is dropping, trying kicking & pulling slightly harder	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2550	Top & bottom of each pedalstroke	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
2565	No mashing, just one fluid motion with constant pressure	8	0	0	72	16777215	5
2625	Keep it up, just 4 more bursts!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2715	Keep spinning those legs!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2730	Last one, smooth as silk!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2745	Time to recover, back way off & breeeeeeathe	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2745	Backpedal for a bit and relax every muscle you can	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2745	Alright, this 4th set is our toughest yet	8	0	0	72	16777215	195
2745	180% FTP may feel like an all out effort at this point	8	0	0	72	16777215	205
2745	But once again, repeatable power is the objective	8	0	0	72	16777215	215
2745	If you can't hit your power or you're bailing more than twice per set...	8	0	0	72	16777215	225
2745	drop the Workout Intensity to a manageable yet challenging level	8	0	0	72	16777215	255
2745	And while these pace fluctuations make it easy to "lose yourself" in the effort...	8	0	0	72	16777215	265
2745	don't let it happen - stay focused, calm & relaxed	8	0	0	72	16777215	275
2745	Pain faces, no matter how gnarly, don't make you faster ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
