0	Today's 90-minute workout has two distinct sections:	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
0	A section of racewinner intervals...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
0	and a section of microbursts	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
0	This makes Junction a workout not for the fainthearted	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
0	If you're not well-rested, consider dialing the intensity down	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
0	This is a substantial workout, even at a lower intensity	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
0	Of course, don't let this intimidate you...	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
0	as this workout is certainly doable if you're well-recovered	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
0	3-minute clearing effort coming up in 30 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	270
300	Time to get those legs ready for some racewinners	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
300	Find a cadence of no less than 85rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
300	Better yet, shoot for a cadence of 90+rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
480	Next up are three, short, sprint efforts	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
480	Strive for 100+rpm for these sprints, higher if you can control it	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
600	6 seconds each time!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
606	Ease up but keep your legs quick	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
630	Back off again but keep most of your leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
654	4 minutes to recover your breathing & slow your HR	8	0	0	72	16777215	6
654	Next up are the racewinner intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	156
654	Racewinners are made up of a 12-second sprint at 150% of FTP...	8	0	0	72	16777215	166
654	followed by 4 minutes at 95% of FTP	5	0	0	72	16777215	176
654	The 12-second sprints will enhance muscle fiber recruitment...	8	0	0	72	16777215	186
654	followed by some muscular endurance work during the subsequent 4 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	196
654	You'll be taxing (and eventually improving) both anaerobic & aerobic power today	8	0	0	72	16777215	206
654	30 seconds out, start thinking about your cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	216
654	Shoot for at least 100rpm for the sprint...	8	0	0	72	16777215	226
654	even as high as 120-130rpm as long as you can control it	8	0	0	72	16777215	236
900	Go! 15 seconds	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
915	Nice, don't let your cadence drop too much	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
915	Try to keep it at 90rpm or higher while you...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
915	use this short ramp to regain composure & settle in	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
960	Try not to let your cadence drop for the next 4 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
960	Pedaling at a higher cadence is more efficient in terms of muscle fatigue...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
960	because a slow cadence places the brunt of the work on your muscles...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
960	whereas a faster cadence shifts the stress toward your heart & lungs	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1200	Take deep, full breaths to make the most out of this minute of recovery	8	0	0	72	16777215	0

1560	Try not to let your cadence drop too much during these brief recoveries	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1560	Bring your cadence back up going again in 10 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
1620	Drill it, 15 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
1635	Steadily ramp things back up & try to clear any heaviness	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1680	Stay tough! You have a full 5 minutes of recovery ahead of you	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
1680	Make this last kick look easy!	5	0	0	72	16777215	200
1890	Hold your leg speed or increase it...all the way to the top!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1920	First set - done!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1920	Enjoy 5 minutes of well-earned recovery	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1920	Next set starts in 30 seconds	5	0	0	72	16777215	270
1920	Make sure your cadence is at least 100rpm BEFORE the interval starts	8	0	0	72	16777215	280
2220	15 seconds HARD!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
2235	Slow your legs but don't back off too far	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2280	OK, settle into a sustainable cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2280	Shoot for something above 85rpm	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
2280	Once you've settled into a sustainable cadence...	8	0	0	72	16777215	45
2280	check your position on the saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	55
2280	Make sure that your pelvis isn't tilted too far forward	8	0	0	72	16777215	65
2280	A good way to avoid this is to position your sit bones...	8	0	0	72	16777215	75
2280	on the wings (widest part) of your saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	85
2520	Quick bit of rest, take deep, full breaths	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2520	Next sprint in 10 seconds, get ready	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
2580	Fast legs, 15 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
2595	Start to dial things back up as you recover your breathing	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2640	Time to settle in to sustainable spin above 90rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2640	Stay as relaxed as possible as the fatigue grows...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2640	and consider dropping down into a slightly more aerodynamic position	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2640	Just like you're off the front!	5	0	0	72	16777215	30
2880	Excellent, only 1 to go. Take it easy for a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2880	Time to bring that cadence back up, next sprint is in 10 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
2940	Last sprint, go hard!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
2955	Gradually work your power back up	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3000	This is the last interval of its kind in this workout...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3000	so don't allow yourself to bail out early unless you absolutely have to	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3000	Last 30-second kick just ahead	5	0	0	72	16777215	200
3210	Again, do your best to make this look like you're not working	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3210	Try to display PERFECT form all the way up	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3240	And relax! Keep the pedals turning forward for at least another 30 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3240	About 5 minutes until we start the microburst portion of the workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3240	Microbursts are one of the best ways to spend your training time because...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3240	they allow you to accumulate a lot of time at a higher percentage of FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3240	than you could normally hold for an extended period of time	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
3240	These microbursts are typical in that they're each 15 seconds at 150% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
3240	The recovery intervals are stadard fare too, 15 seconds long	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
3240	Microbursts target anaerobic improvements as well as aerobic ones	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
3240	What starts out predominantly anaerobic becomes...	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
3240	increasingly aerobic as you fatigue over the course of the sets	8	0	0	72	16777215	100
3240	Take another few minutes to spin your legs out	8	0	0	72	16777215	110
3240	About 1 minute until we start the microbursts	8	0	0	72	16777215	240
3240	Make sure you have a quick cadence for these	8	0	0	72	16777215	250
3240	100rpm is great, 110rpm is better, 120rpm is ideal...	8	0	0	72	16777215	260
3240	but it all comes down to the fastest cadence you can control	8	0	0	72	16777215	270
3240	Bring your cadence up...	5	0	0	72	16777215	290
3540	And go! 15 seconds at a time	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3555	15 seconds rest but KEEP YOUR LEGS QUICK	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3570	15 seconds of high power...	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3585	15 seconds of quick, easy spinning...	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3585	Rinse & repeat ;)	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
3765	Halfway through the first set!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3765	If you absolutely need to, you can backpedal through a few seconnds of each recovery valley	8	0	0	72	16777215	7
3795	Alternatively, you can skip the occasional microburst by backpedaling	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3825	You'll know you NEED a break when you can't keep your speed and/or power	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4005	Nicely done! You have just over 3 minutes to recover	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4005	If you had to backpedal through 3 or more microbursts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
4005	consider dropping the Workout Intensity a bit, maybe 5-10%	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
4005	What you've done is already a substantial workout...	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
4005	and you'll benefit more from completing full sets of microbursts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
4005	than completing partial sets by skipping too many intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
4005	That said, these are meant to be uncomfortable...	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
4005	so unless you HAD to skip intervals, try to leave the intensity alne for now	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
4005	Next interval is fast approaching, so start finding your cadence now	8	0	0	72	16777215	175
4200	Here we go! Round 2	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4215	High leg speed the ENTIRE time unless you're backpedaling	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4485	More than halfway through, stay tough, stay focused	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4665	Excellent! Only one set to go	8	0	0	72	16777215	5
4665	One minute more of rest, so start to think about...	8	0	0	72	16777215	135
4665	your cadence & your breathing habits	8	0	0	72	16777215	145
4665	Don't wait to take full, deep breaths until you have to, especially with a high cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	155
4665	Get on top of your breathing early in this last set, ANY set...	8	0	0	72	16777215	165
4665	by taking full breaths right from the very first microburst	8	0	0	72	16777215	175
4860	Here we go, lots of leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4875	Keep most of that leg speed if not all of it	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
5085	Halfway through it, do your best to stay relaxed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
5115	Each time you recovery, try to get rid of any unnecessary tension	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
5235	3 microbursts left, no skipping intervals now!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
5265	Good! Just 2 to go	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
5295	Only 1 left, prettiest form of the day!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
5325	Excellent! That was a BRUTE of a workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
5325	Take more than the minute & 15 seconds of cool-down allotted, and while you do...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
5325	start to plan (or consume) your post-workout recovery nutrition	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
5325	We'll see you next time	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
